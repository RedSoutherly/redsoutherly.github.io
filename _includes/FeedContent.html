<div class="block">
    <h1>Welcome to my research blog (◕‿◕✿)</h1>
    
    Here you will find "posts", or notes, regarding research that I am doing.<br>
    Currently this will just pertain to the summer research project I am working on. Although in the furture it may extend to other projects, 
    at which point I will likely sort them into separate directories.
