    <h1>Welcome to my research blog (◕‿◕✿)</h1>
    
    Here you will find posts regarding research that I am doing.<br>
    Currently this will just pertain to the summer research project I am working on. Although in the furture it may extend to other projects, 
    at which point you will be able to separate them using the <a class="content" href="../tags/">tags</a> page.
