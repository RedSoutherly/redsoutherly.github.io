Terms and Conditions is an Android mobile game developed as a group project in COSC345 Software Engineering, at the University of Otago. This paper was based around a full-year group project where we had to create a mobile app with the given theme of "anarchy".

I worked in a team of three, holding the role of lead programmer. This meant that I was responsible for the majority of the code, and for having oversight over the rest of the code written by my teammates.

The game itself is intended as a satirical view of working as an Amazon Distribution worker.
