Feline Felony is a WebGL game created as the group project for COSC360 Computer Game Design. I took this paper in the summer school period of 2020 at the University of Otago.

I worked in a team of four, with myself holding the lead programmer position. Making me responsible for most of the logic and control scripts that make the game run as intended. Due to the project being coursework and involving multiple people, the source code is not public. Although the game can be played on itch.io using the link above.

The following gives an overview of the game, as described in conceptual documents internal to the project.

### Overview
Feline Felony is a stealth game with platformer based movement. You play as a cat stealing food and items of luxury for your cat friends back at your alleyway home. Sneaking into high class houses, you make your way through them without being caught by the inhabitants like the humans or their pets. You will be stealing cat food, catnip and perhaps even jewellery. We want the player to use the environment around them to distract the enemies in creative ways so that they’ll be able to get to the items without getting spotted. You’ll be able to jump on top of furniture such as tables, couches, bookshelves, benches, etc; as well as crawl under some of these things to hide from your enemies. Some of these surfaces will have objects like glasses that you can knock down; either onto the floor to make a loud noise, or onto an unsuspecting enemies head! The level/s will comprise of a full house that you’ll be able to walk around and look for the items you need. The hallway will be looking from a top down perspective where you can navigate between rooms, which will change your perspective to a 2D side on view. You can run, walk, sneak, and of course jump; all of which have different noise levels that affect how easily detected you are. If you are too loud too close to an enemy you will make them suspicious. They will look around the room, and if they find you, they will give chase. So your job is to collect the mission objectives, without being caught.
