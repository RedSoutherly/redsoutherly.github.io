The abstract for this project proposed a more immersive way of exploring historic photographs, including being able to see them in the location of their origin. The general idea is to use the tools of augmented reality (AR) to put the user in the place of the camera from many years ago. So when they look at a building we can overlay precisely placed historic photographs to give the sense that you are looking back in time at how it once stood.

The two videos below show a demonstration of the concept. Where the user can look around in their space and view the historic image. The key point is how we will align the image with the real-world subject. In these examples, the image is aligned on a 3D video where each frame can be corrected in advance. But this will become more difficult when we try to make this a live experience using AR.

You may also note that the user stays in a stationary position for this demonstration. This is another obstacle we must figure out. Since we want the user to be able to move around the environment while keeping the subject static and aligned with the real world.

The final goal of the project is to have the software working and deployed on lightweight AR glasses, akin to that of [Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/). This way we will be able to provide users with an easy and dynamic way to explore environments paired with historic photographs. Which could be intended for personal use or applied to an industry like tourism or surveying.
